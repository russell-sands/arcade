# Arcade Functions
Repository of ArcGIS Arcade functions.

## getFullAddressType
Useful when you want to display the full information about geocode match levels from Esri's geocoder. Based on a check of the documentation in early 2020. 

## getStatisticsByField
Useful when you have polygon features and want to summarize information from point data within each polygon. Allows you to define the statistics you want back, and returns a string that contains the statistics you requested for the feaures within the polygon.

## makeOrdinalText
Useful when you want ordinal decorators on text. Option to add a "flavor" decorator. For example "lowest" would turn 2 -> "2nd lowest" and 1 -> "lowest".

##shortenNumber
Shorten a number to a string representation with number prefixing. Also handle small non-zero numbers.

##shortenDecimal
Shorten a decimal to a set number of digits, and for small numbers distinguish between the minimum, below the minimum, and zero.
